============

This plugin is `available on PyPi. <https://pypi.org/project/manim-rubikscube/>`_
Usage of this plugin assumes that Python and Manim are both correctly installed. Manim is listed as a dependency, but no version is specified. This is because the plugin will work with any version of Manim Community that does not have breaking changes to the plugin.

To see what versions of Manim are confirmed to be compatible with this plugin (to the best of my testing), `see Releases. <https://github.com/WampyCakes/manim-rubikscube/releases>`_ By no means is this exclusive. Most releases of this plugin will work, more or less, on all versions of Manim Community.
